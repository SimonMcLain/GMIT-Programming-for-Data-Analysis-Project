# GMIT Programming for Data Analysis Project

Project 2019
Programming for Data Analysis
For this project students must create a dataset by simluating a real-world phenomenon of their choosing. They may pikc any phenomeon they wish. Then, rather than collect the data related to the phenomenon, they should model and synthesise such data using Python using the numpy.random package for this purpose.

Students should:

- Choose a real-world phenomenon that canbe measured and for which they could collect at least 100-hundred data points across at least 4 variables.
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with eachother.
- Synthese/ simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail their research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook - the dataset itself can be displaed in an output cell within the notebook.



#### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Create a GitHub account and clone or copy the repository. Public access has been granted to the repository and is available for use under the terms of the APACHE licence. 

Link: https://github.com/SimonMcLain/GMIT-Programming-for-Data-Analysis---Practicals.git

To run the file open it in Juypter notebook, with is included in the anaconda download. See Prerequsites below. 

On the command line access the repository on your local machine, run Juypter notebook and open the file named numpy-random.ipynb.

Once the file is open in Jupyter notebook on the ribbon click on Kernal, then restart and run all. The charts and descriptive statistics will be displayed.


#### Prerequisites

Your will require Python to be loaded on your local machine. I recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.
