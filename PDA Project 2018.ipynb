    "## Lifestyle risk indicators\n",
    "For this project I decided to base the simulated data on the real world phenomenon of factors that contribute to increased lifestyle risk. Lifestyle risk factors are defined by the Irish Health and Safety Executive as *\"largely preventable...including tobacco and alcohol usage, together with physical inactivity, poor diet and obesity\"*. Lifestyle risk factors are behaviours, the degree to which an individual indulges in them can indicate their propensity to develop chronic diseases. They are however not definitive, there are many factors that can influence an individuals likelihood of developing chronic diseases, but it is well recognised that certain behaviours do have a strong influence. \n",
    "\n",
    "While researching this project I concluded the main measurable factors that influence lifestype risk are:\n",
    "- Diet \n",
    "- Smoking\n",
    "- Alcohol Consumption\n",
    "- Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section I will discuss each of these factors and how they combined to increase the risk of an individual developing a chronic disease. For this project I imagined that an employer asked me to produce a Python script that would calculate lifestyle risk, and that ultimately the scipt would be used to interpret data collected during a voluntary street survey, however some testing of the script's accurancy using simulated data was required before the survey was to be conducted. \n"

    "### Diet\n",
    "Body Mass Index is a well established measurement of whether an individual is overweight of underweight. As such I have used it for a proxy measurement for whether or not a person has a healthy diet. \n",

    "Using the metric system Body Mass Index is calculated by dividing an individual's weight in Kilograms by the square of their height in metres. \n",

    "- The average height of a man in Ireland is 177cm \n",
    "- The average height of a woman in Ireland is 163cm \n",
    "- The average weight of a man in Ireland is 80.7 kilograms and 72% of men are overweight\n",
    "- The average weight of a woman in Ireland is 69 kilograms and 52% of women are overweight\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of simulating data I concluded the mean heights and weights could be created using a normal distribution. I also discovered that 48% of the population is male and 52% female, deciding to factor this into the simulated data as the prevalence of smoking varies by gender. HSE guidance for lower-risk alcohol consumption also varies by gender. \n",

    "The prevalance of smoking in Ireland is very well documented. The HSE's smoking prevalence tracker Half Year - 2018 survey carried out by Ipsos MRBI indicates that 21.1% of men and 16.6% of women smoke one of more cigarettes each week. "

    "## Alcohol Consumption\n",
    "Alcohol Action Ireland, an advocacy group for the reduction of alcohol harm, advises that there is no \"safe\" amount of alcohol. That drinking any amount increases the risk of damage to health and risk generally increases in line with how much is drunk. Binge drinking being associated with additional health risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guidelines for men are 17 standard drinks of alcohol per week, and 11 standard drinks of alcohol per week for women. The CSO data on per capita alchohol consumption in Ireland is estimates it at 11.46 litres pure alcohol per year. One standard drink contains 13ml of pure alcohol. So on average the per capita alcohol consumption in Ireland is 16.95 standard units per week without factoring gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other factors involved in alcohol consumption and risk. Over 19% of people in Ireland do not drink alcohol, 83% of men and 79% of women consume alcohol. As noted, risk is also influenced by drinking behaviours such as binge drinking, defined by the World Health Organisation as consuming six or more standard drinks in one session.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of simulating alcohol consumption I assumed a uniform distribution of alcohol consumption between zero and twenty units per week. Individuals who consume in excess of the maximum recommended weekly number of standard units where considered to be heavy drinkers. Individuals who comsumed the maximum weekly units or under where considered moderate drinkers. Moderate drinking not being considered a sigificant factor in increasing lifestyle risk. "

    "## Purpose and development of the code\n",
    "The primary purpose of this code is to assign a 'Lifestyle Risk' category based on: Body Mass Index, smoker or non-smoker, weekly alcohol consumption and exercise. In my imaginary scenario my employeer will conduct a survey that measures height and weight then asks; if respondents smoke, how much alcohol they consume on a weekly basis and how much strenuous exercise the take on a weekly basis. In advance of conducting the survey I simulate a dataset to aid the development and testing of the final algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Respondents will also indicate their gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulating gender\n",
    "Gender is simulated by numpy.random.choice() between 'Male' and 'Female' with a probability of 0.48 male and 0.52 female based on CSO popluation statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulating BMI\n",
    "As previously mentioned BMI is simulated using height and weights that approximate the population of Ireland. Due to an absence of detailed data on height and weight the standard deviations where based on those for the average age of the popluation of Ireland, which is 37. I populated a column in the pandas array that recieved this simple arithmatic. Then I used pandas.cut() to convert this continuous BMI variable to the catagorical variables 'Underweight', 'Normal', 'Overweight' and 'Obese'. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulating smoking\n",
    "Smoker or non-smoker is simulated by defining a function. If a respondent is male numpy.random.choice() assigns 'Yes' or 'No'. Males have a probability of 0.211 for being a smoker and Females have a probability of 0.166 for being a smoker.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulating alcohol consumption\n",
    "To simulate alcohol consumption I defined a function assumed a uniform distribution of alcohol consumption between zero and twenty units per week. This is inaccurate as it does sufficiently describe actual alcohol consumption in Ireland. However I considered it sufficient for the purpose of the simulation. With this data I created a second function that again converted the continuous variable into catagorical variables. Moderate drinking was assigned if less than the recommended standard units of alcohol where consumed each week. Heavy drinking was assigned if more than the recommended standard units of alcohol were consumed. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulating exercise\n",
    "I first created a list containing minutes of exercise per week. I again used numpy.random.choice() passing probabilities that the respondents undertake certain minutes of exercise each week. The probabilities approximating data provided in HSE surveys. Less than 150 minutes of exercise per week was used to assign a higher risk catagory. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining lifestyle risk\n",
    "I defined a function that iterates over all of the possible combinations of continuous and catagorial variables and returns probable lifestyle risks as follows:\n",
    "- Normal\n",
    "- Medium\n",
    "- High\n",
    "- Very High\n",
    "- Extremely High\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-smokers who participated in more than 150 minutes of exercise per week where given a 'turning-their-life-around' pass and awarded a lower lifestyle risk rating.\n",

    "### Further development of the project\n",
    "The code could be substantially improved by analysing original data on for all of the risk factors by heights, weights and ages ages. Since alcohol consumption, prevalence of smoking, BMI and exercise all vary by age. Ages in Ireland also follow a trapizoidal distribution which would have been a good inclusion. Drinking behaviours where not included in the simulation and could have been by defining an additional function and associated column in the DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "This statistical distributions where largely inferred from HSE publications that give the percentage of individuals in Ireland who drink and smoker. Unfortunately during my research original I could not find a suitable source of raw data without paying for a subscription service. \n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight by choosing to convert randomly generated continuous variable to categorical variables I missed an obvious opportunity to apply machine learning to this project. I could have focused the project on applying scikit-learn to more efficiently predict lifestyle risk."
